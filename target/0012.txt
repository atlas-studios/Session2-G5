Chapter 12: Here Again 

Melissa, can you not rub my nose in it..... Klein muttered inwardly. He felt a throbbing pain in his head.  

The amount of content Klein had forgotten was not too much, yet it was definitely not little as well. The interview is in two days, how will he find time to make up for it?

Furthermore, he was involved in such strange paranormal activity, how will he have the heart to "revise"? 

Klein gave her sister a superficial response and began studying pretentiously. Melissa brought a chair over to sit beside him. With light shining from the gas lamp, she began on her assignments. 

The atmosphere was serene. When it was almost eleven o'clock, the siblings bid each other goodnight, and went to bed. 

…

KNOCK!

KNOCK! KNOCK!

Poundings on the door roused Klein from his dreams.

He peered out of the window to see the first glimmer of dawn. In a daze, he flipped over and sat up：

"Who is it?"

Look at the time now! Why didn't Melissa wake me up?

"It's me. Dunn Smith." a man with a deep voice outside the door replied. 

Dunn Smith? Don't know him...... Klein got off his bed and shook his head as he walked towards the door. 

As he opened the door, the Gray-Eyed Policeman whom he had met the day before stood in front of him.

Alarmed, Klein asked, "Is there something wrong?"

Gray-Eyed Policeman replied with a stern look,

"We found a cart driver. He witnessed that on the 27th, which is also the day when Mr Welch and Miss Nayer died, you went to Mr Welch's apartment. Furthermore, Mr Welch was the one who paid for your transportation fees." 

Klein was startled. He did not feel a tinge of fear or guilt as if his lies were being exposed.

It was because, he was not even lying. In fact, he was unsurpised by the evidence provided by Dunn Smith the Gray-Eyed Policeman.

On 27th June, he indeed still went to Mr Welch's apartment. On the night that he returned, he killed himself, the exact same way as Welch and Nayer did! 

Klein gave a forced smile and said,  

"This is insufficient evidence. It does not directly prove that I am associated with the death of Welch and Nayer. Honestly speaking, I'm also very curious about the whole incident. I want to know what exactly happened to my two poor friends. But... But.. I really can't remember. In fact I have almost completely forgotten what I had done on the 27th. You may find it hard to believe, but I fully relied on the diaries I had written to roughly make a guess that I had went to Welch's apartment on the 27th."

"You sure have a great mental state." the Gray-Eyed Policeman Dunn Smith said while nodding. There was not a trace of anger, nor was he smiling. 

"You should be able to hear my sincerity." Klein looked him straight in the eye and said. 

I'm telling the truth! Of course, only part of it! 

Dunn Smith did not give an immediate response. He glanced around the room, then said slowly,  

"Mr Welch lost a revolver. I guess... I should be able to find it here. Right? Mr Klein?"

Indeed...... Klein finally understood where the revolver had come from. A thought flashed in his mind and he came to the final verdict in an instant. 

He raised his hands and retreated, leaving a path open. Then, he signalled at the bunk bed with his chin.

"Behind the bed board."

He did not specifically mention that it was the bottom deck, as no one would normally hide things at the back of the bed board on an upper deck. That would be too obvious for guests to notice at a glance. 

Gray-Eyed Policeman did not move forward. He flinched and asked, 

"Nothing to add on?"

Without hesitation, Klein replied,

“There is!”

“Yesterday, when I woke up in the middle of the night, I realised I was laying on my desk with a revolver beside me. There is a bullet at the corner of the room. It was as if I had committed suicide. But due to a lack of experience and never having used a gun, or maybe I was too scared at the final moment.. Anyway, the bullet did not achieve the desired result, my mind is still perfect. I am still alive now.”

“And since then, I lost some memories, including what I saw and did at Welch's apartment on the 27th. I'm not lying. I really can't remember.”

为了洗清嫌疑，为了解决缠上自己的诡异事件，克莱恩几乎说出了全部的事情，除开穿越和“聚会”。

另外，他在措辞上有所修饰，让每句话都能经得起考验，比如没说子弹未击中脑袋，只提未达到预想的效果，事后头部依旧完好。

在旁人耳中，这两者几乎表达一样的意思，但实际上截然不同。

灰眸警官邓恩安静听完，沉缓开口：

“这很符合我推测的发展，也符合之前类似事件的隐藏逻辑，当然，我不知道你是怎么活下来的。”

“你相信就好，我也不知道我怎么活下来的。”克莱恩稍微松了口气。

“但是。”邓恩抛出了一个转折词，“我相信没用，现在的你有很高的嫌疑，你必须通过‘专家’的确认，确认你真地遗忘了遭遇，或者真地没直接导致韦尔奇先生和娜娅女士的死亡。”

他咳嗽一声，表情变得严肃：

“克莱恩先生，请你配合调查，和我们回一趟警局，这大概需要两到三天，如果你确实没有问题的话。”

“专家到了？”克莱恩愣愣反问。

Didn't they say it would take another two days？

“她比我们预料得都早。”邓恩侧过身体，示意克莱恩出门。

“我留张纸条。”克莱恩请求道。

班森还在出差，梅丽莎上学去了，只能留言告诉他们自己涉及韦尔奇的一件事情，让他们不要担心。

邓恩不甚在意地点头：

"Can."

克莱恩回到书桌旁，一边找出纸张书写，一边开始思考接下来的事情。

老实说，他非常不希望见那位专家，毕竟自身还藏着一个更大的秘密。

在有七大教会的地方，在疑似“前辈”的罗塞尔大帝被刺杀的前提下，“穿越”这种事情多半是要进裁判所，上仲裁庭的！

但是，没武器，没格斗技巧，没超凡之力的自己哪里是职业警官的对手，更何况，门外昏暗里还站着几位邓恩的下属。

他们拔枪一个齐射，自己就算交代了！

“呼，走一步算一步。”克莱恩留下纸条，拿上钥匙，跟着邓恩出了房间。

昏暗的走廊里，四位黑衣白格的警察分列两边，非常戒备。

啪，啪，啪，克莱恩跟在邓恩身边，踩着木制的楼梯，一阶一阶往下，时而能听到吱吱呀呀的声音。

公寓门外停着一辆四轮单马的马车，它厢体侧面绘刻有“双剑交叉、簇拥王冠”的警察系统标志，周围和之前每个清晨一样热热闹闹，拥挤嘈杂。

“上去吧。”邓恩示意克莱恩先。

克莱恩刚要迈步，突然有个卖牡蛎的小贩抓住一位顾客，指责对方是小偷。

双方扭打起来，惊到了马匹，周围顿时变得混乱。

An opportunity!

克莱恩来不及多想，猛地弯腰前冲，抢入了人群里。

或推搡，或闪避，他疯狂奔逃，向着街道另外一头。

现在的情况下，为了不“见”专家，只能去城外码头，坐船顺塔索克河而下，逃到首都贝克兰德去，那里人口众多，便于隐藏。

当然，也能扒蒸汽列车，往东去最近的恩马特港口，走海路到普利兹，然后才前往贝克兰德。

不多时，克莱恩跑到了街口，拐入了铁十字街，那里停着几辆可雇佣的马车。

“去城外码头。”克莱恩手一撑，跳上了其中一辆。

他想的很清楚，要先故意误导追赶的警察，等到马车驶出一段距离，自己就直接跳下去！

“好的。”车夫扯起了缰绳。

Clop Clop Clop... The chariot left Iron Cross Street. 

正当克莱恩准备跳车时，他忽然发现马车拐向了另外一条路，并非通往城外的道路！

“你要去哪里？”克莱恩愣了一下，脱口问道。

“去韦尔奇的住所……”马车夫语气不见起伏地回答。

什么？克莱恩惊愕之中，马车夫转过身体，露出深邃冷漠的灰色眼眸，俨然便是邓恩.史密斯警官！

“你！”克莱恩惊恐莫名，突感天旋地转，整个人猛然坐了起来。

坐了起来？克莱恩疑惑地左看右看，发现窗外红月正盛，房间铺满“轻纱”。

他伸手摸了下额头，湿润而冰凉，尽是冷汗，背后也是同样的感觉。

“Had a nightmare......" Klein heaved a sigh, "All is well... All is well......"

他觉得自己梦里还挺清醒的，还能冷静思考，颇为奇怪。

稍微缓和后，克莱恩拿起怀表看了一眼，发现才半夜两点多，于是悄声下床，打算去公用盥洗室洗个脸，顺便解决下憋胀的小腹问题。

扭开房门，他来到昏暗的过道上，就着微弱难辨的月光，脚步很轻地靠近公用盥洗室。

突然，他看到走廊尽头的窗户前站了一道人影。

那人影穿着比长袍短、比正装长的黑色类风衣服饰，

那人影半融入于黑暗里，沐浴着清冷的绯红月华。

那人影缓缓转过了身体，眼眸深邃、灰暗、冷漠。

Dunn Smith!
