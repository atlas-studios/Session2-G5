Chapter 13: Night-Watchman

Clack!

Klein cannot help but take a step back. For a moment he was not sure whether he was awake or still in his dreams.

The silhouette took down his black top hat and bowed a little, and he said with a smile, 

"Reintroducing myself, Night-Watchman, Dunn Smith."

Night-Watchman? One of the Beyonder group codename of the Evernight Goddess Church that 'Justice' and 'The Hanged Man' mentioned before? Klein suddenly realised something, and exclaimed before associating further, 

"You can control dreams? You just made me dream of that?"

Night-Watchman Dunn Smith put on his black hat, covering his slightly high hairline. With deep grey eyes he said, 

"No, I only entered your dream and made the necessary guidance."

His voice is deep and soothing, reverberating through the dimly lit corridor without disturbing the sweet dreams of others, 

"Within dreams, even though those suppressed sentiments and all kinds of dark mentality are enlarged, making everything seemed chaotic, absurd and crazy, reality still exists - hidden within. For veterans like me, everything is crystal clear. Compared to a conscious you, I believe the one in the dreams more." 

This...which normal human being can control his dream? If I dreamed of something on Earth, wouldn't Dunn Smith finds out? Klein was petrified by what had happened in the dream.

Yet he quickly found it bizarre. He remembered being very much sober and rational - knowing what to say and what not to say.

To put it simply, it doesn't feel like dreaming at all!

So, Dunn Smith only "saw" what I want him to see?

Klein's thoughts came flashing, with a glimmer of understanding.

This is the benefit of transmigration? Like having miraculous power? Or it was the effects of that luck enhancement ritual?

"So, Mr Smith, do you believe that I really lost my memory?" Klein organised his words and asked in reply.

Dunn Smith did not answer directly. Instead he looked at him keenly,

"You are actually not surprised by this matter?"

"I've met people who wouldn't believe in the power of Beyonders, and they would rather think that they haven't really woke up."

"Um" Klein responds,

"Maybe because I was praying, hoping there was such power to help me."

"An interesting logic...maybe you survived not just because of being lucky." Dunn nods expressionlessly, "I can now confirm that you really lost parts of your memory due to this incident, especially those related to it."

"So can I go back now?" Klein heave a long sigh of relief internally, probing with intent.

Dunn placed a hand in his pocket and walked slowly towards Klein, the surrounding darkness became tranquil and gentle.

"No, you still have to come with me to see the 'expert'." He smiled politely and said.

"Why?" Klein blurted out, then added, "You don't believe your guidance in the dream?"

You must be joking, if that "expert" specialises in hypnosis or mind-reading and stuff, then wouldn't my biggest secret be exposed?

The consequences are beyond imagination!

"I'm quite humble usually, but I'm still confident for things related to dreams." Dunn calmly replied, "but, for key, important things, it's better to confirm again. Plus, her ability is much different from mine, maybe it can help you recover some of your memories."

Not waiting for Klein to reply, his voice turned deeper,

"After all you're connected to the whereabouts of that Antigonus family notebook."

"What?" Klein was startled for a bit.

Dunn stopped in front of him, locking his grey eyes on Klein's eyes and said,

"On the scene there was not a single trace of that notebook from the Fourth Epoch. Welch is dead, Naya is dead, you are our only lead."

"...Alright then." Klein went slient for a moment before replying.

A missing notebook... now this is really peculiar!

How did I not think about the whereabouts of that notebook from the Fourth Epoch!

Dunn nodded slightly, walking pass Klein and says,

"Go lock your door and come with me to Welch's apartment, the 'expert' is waiting for us there."

Klein breathed in sliently, feeling apprehensive and nervous.

He wants to refuse, even escape, but with what was learned in his dreams, Dunn Smith definitely raised his guard. And with the difference in strength between a normal human and a Beyonder, chances of success in forcing it is quite low.

He must have a revolver with him too... naturally the type with much shooting practice...

Many thoughts flashed past his mind, and eventually Klein chose to accept the reality.

"Alright."

Sigh, I can only take one step at a time and see how things unfold, maybe that miraculous power would take effect again...

"Then let's go." Dunn said in an indifferent tone.

Klein turned and followed two steps. He stopped and suddenly said,

"Mr Smith, I... I would like to go to the bathroom first."

I came out originally for the bathroom...

Dunn did not stop him, instead giving him a keen look and said,

"No problem Klein. Believe me, I am far more powerful than you can imagine in the dark night."

In the dark night... Klein silently repeated this phrase.

He did not make any reckless attempt, and honestly relieved himself. He then washed his face with cold water, completely calming himself down.

Klein changed his outfit and closed his door. With gentle steps Klein followed Dunn down the stairs and walked towards the apartment door.

In such tranquil setting, Dunn Smith opened his mouth and spoke suddenly,

"At the end of the dream, why did you try to escape? What are you afraid of?"

Klein ponders instantly, and answered while thinking,

"I don't remember what I did at Welch's place, and I also forgot whether I caused his and Naya's death directly. I was afraid if it was really proven to be my doings, I would rather escape and not take the gamble, starting anew in the Southern Continent."

"If I were you, I would've done the same." Dunn said as he pushed opened the apartment door, letting in the cool breeze of the midnight that disperse the sweltering heat inside.

He was not afraid of Klein running away, as he got on the carriage. It was exactly the one Klein had dreamed of - four-wheeled, single horse, cart driver, and that police logo "Double Cross Swords, Escort The Crown" carved on the side of the carriage.

Klein followed inside. Inside there was a thick ground mat laid out and the place was filled with soothing banana fragrance. 

Having seated down, he looked for a topic as he tried to probe for more information.

"Mr Smith, what if... I'm saying what if the 'expert' proved that I really forgotten that piece of memory? And no other evidence proves that I'm the perpetrator and not the victim, would this be over?"

"In theory, yes we will use other means to find that notebook. As long as it exists, it can be found. Of course, before that, we will have to make sure you are not cursed, not left with any scent of cacodemon and also without related psychological problems. So that you can embrace the rest of your life peacefully and healthily."

Klein caught on to this point sharply, and promptly inquired,

"In theory?"

"Yes, only in theory. In this field, there are always twisted, unorthodox and inexplicable things happening." Dunn looked at Klein in the eyes and said, "Their continuance, their end, are not what we can foresee or control sometimes."

"For example?" Klein was actually frightened for a moment.

The carriage sped through an almost empty street. Dunn took out his tobacco pipe and sniffed, saying,

"When we thought things are over, and everything goes back to normal, it would resurface in a terrifying, chilling way."

"A few years ago, we encountered a case on heresy. They did live sacrifices to please the demon by making followers commit suicide. When one of the followers was chosen, his survival instincts defeated foolishness, twisted beliefs and illusions, and reported to the police.

"The case was handed over to us. It was a very small mission, since there was no Beyonders in that cult, and the deity they worship was actually randomly thought up by their leader all for the sake of money and satisfaction. Humanity was lost there."

"We only used two group members with police cooperation to deal with this cult. No one was off the hook. For that whistle blower, we also confirmed that he doesn't have demonic scent left behind, not cursed, not even mental disorders. He doesn't have any personality problems and other irregularities, nothing."

"Later, he got a nice career development, got married to a decent wife, had a boy and a girl. His terrifying, bloody past seemed to have vanished, completely out of the shadows.

At this point, Dunn Smith gave out a laugh and said,

"Yet in March, such person who has a good financial status, loving wife, and adorable kids... strangled himself to death in his office."

The crimson moonlight outside the carriage window glowed upon Dunn Smith.

At this instance, his seemingly self mocking smile actually made Klein feel unspeakably horrified. 

"Strangled himself to death..." Klein breathed in the cool air silently, as if seeing his own tragic end.

Even if I escaped it once, I can only run away for a while?

Is there any way to resolve this completely?

Become a Beyonder to counter it?

The carriage returned to silence. Countless thoughts went up and down Klein's mind.

Under such awkward silence, the carriage traveled for a long period at high speed.

Just as Klein made up his mind to consult Dunn Smith for any solutions, the carriage came to a halt. 

"Mr Smith, we have reached Welch's apartment." The cart driver's voice was heard.

"Let's get down." Dunn straightened out his black coat that reached his knees.

"Oh, let me introduce beforehand, the official disguise of the 'expert' is the most renowned spirit medium of Awwa County."

Klein restrained any other thoughts and asked curiously,

"Then what is her actual identity?"

Dunn half-turned his body and turned his head back, with his abstruse grey eyes he said,

"A true 'spirit medium'."
