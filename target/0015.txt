Chapter 15 Invitation

"Why?" asked Klein instinctively after listening to Dunn's speech, a wave of tumultuous emotions rose up in his heart. 

The Extraordinary has serious potential danger?  

To the point where problem easily arose from the internal adjustment mechanism of the organization and The Extraordinary who handled evil matters? 

 

" This is not something that you need to understand. Neither is it something you can understand, unless you become one of us."

Klein went silent for a moment, after which he sat down and questioned in a tone that was half dubious and half laughable

"If I don't get this understood, how is it possible for me to make a decision to join in the organization?"

Yet, not joining would meant Klein could not understand the potential danger presented. This would end up in a deadlock... 

Dunn Smith took out his cigarette pipe once again, placed it against his nose and took a breath.

"You most likely misunderstood. A member of us includes civilian staffs."

"That means,as long as I become one of your civilian staffs,I can understand the secrets in the loop and figure out the potential danger posed by The Extraordinary and the possible peril faced. After which, I can decide whether I want to become The Extraordinary or not," Klein said as he reorganized his thoughts and restated Dunn's meaning in his own words.

Dunn smiled. 

"Yes, this is the case. Except that the wish of becoming The Extraordinary is not always granted, because every organization will be equally strict in this aspect."

It had be a wonder if the organizations are not strict... Klein cursed silently, with a hand sign that intensified his tone and added,"

"What about civilian staffs? It should be quite strict as well right?"

" If it's you, there shouldn't be any problem," said Dunn with half-closed eyelids, partially relaxed countenance, as he smelt from the unlit cigarette pipe.

"Why?" Klein asked as he was once again grappled by doubt.

At the same time,he jested,"

"So my specialness and transmigration are akin to the fireflies in the night, every so bright and magnificent?" 

Dunn opened his half-closed eyelids, his silver-colored eyes reflecting the same tranquility as before.

"Firstly,to be able to survive without our help under such situation means that you have merits that surpass others. For instance, luck. Lucky people are always more welcomed"

Seeing that Klein's expression has gone slack, Dunn smiled slightly.

" All right, just treat this as a form of humorous saying. Secondly,you're a history graduate of Khoy University and this is what we desperately need. Although the believers under the Lord of the Storms-Lurmi- perceive women in a way that is loathsome,Lurmi's views regarding the society, humanity, economics and politics remain sharp. He said before that humans are key to sustaining healthy competition and good development, which a point that I very much agree with." 

Noticing Klein's slightly furrowed eyebrows,Dunn casually explained,"

" You should be able to envisage, we'll often be in contact with documents and objects from The Fourth Epoch or even earlier. Many cults and heresies have tried to gain power from those things. Sometimes, the presence of these cults and heresies alone can cause weird and scary events."   

" Besides The Extraordinaries in the special field,many of us are not adept at learning, or we have passed the age of learning." Speaking of which, Dunn Smith pointed at his own brain, and the corner of his mouth turned up as if he was mocking himself. He then spoke,"Those boring knowledge makes people want to sleep, even for those who don't sleep.In the past, we'll find historians or archaeologist to work with, but this has a risk of leakage of secrets and brings unfavorable situations to the head and vice professors. Thus, the addition of a professional and him becoming one of us is definitely irresistible." 

Dunn nodded his head slightly, accepted Klein's saying, thought deeper and asked,"

"Then why don't y'all directly, um, nurture one?"

Self-contained, Dunn continued saying,"

" This is the third point, which is the last and most important point. You've already been through similar ordeal,so inviting you to join us doesn't breach confidentiality. Most of our members and civilian staffs come from the internal departments of the organization." 

After Klein finished listening silently, he asked," 

"Why are y'all so strict at keeping confidentiality? Aren't many of the things that are publicly announced,circulated, known to more people preventive of similar mistakes from happening again? The greatest fear is uncertainty, we can make the uncertain known."

"No,humans' stupidity has exceeded your imagination. It actually causes greater imitation, chaos and more serious events,"Dunn Smith shaked his head and said.

"Um" Klein responds,

"The only lesson that humans can learn from history is that humans do not gain any lesson from history, and they're always repeating the same tragedy." 

"This particular sentence from Emperor Roselle is indeed filled much with philosophical meaning," agreed Dunn. 

...Emperor Roselle said that?

Dunn turned his head and watched the horse carriage from outside. 

"In every big organization's internal adjustment mechanism, there'll be a similar phrase. This may be the main reason for the strict confidentiality, to prohibit the common masses from knowing."

"What is it?"Klein asked as his interest was piqued, pleasured that he seemed to be spying on secrets. 

Dunn turned his head, his facial muscles pulled itself so slightly that it was hardly visible.

"Trust and fear bring troubles. More trust and more fear bring more troubles, till everything is destroyed," 

finishing this sentence, Dunn signed,"

"Besides praying for god's help and blessing, humans can't solve the real big problems.

"Trust and fear bring troubles, more trust and more fear bring more troubles..." Klein recited silently,yet not really understanding it .Followed next was the fear of uncertainty that came from not understanding. It was like dark shadows formed by the street lights outside. In the darkness without light, there seemed to hide a pair of callous looking eyes and a wide-opened mouth.  

As the horse galloped with strong heels, the wheels of the horse carriage reeled on ahead with the Iron Cross Street in sight, Dunn broke the sudden silence and formally invited Klein saying,"

" Do you want to join us and become one of our civilian staffs?"

In Klein's mind, multiple thoughts surfaced, making him indecisive. He contemplated and asked," 

" Can I have consider this?"

Since this matter had serious implications, the decision should not be made hastily and recklessly.

" No problem, just give me the answer before Sunday," Dunn nodded his head," Of course, remember to keep this a secret and don't tell  Welch's related matters to others, including your brother and sister. Once you go against this, you'll not only bring them troubles, but also cause yourself to be presented at the Special Court."  

"Okay," Klein answered seriously.

The car was once again plunged into silence.

Seeing that they were nearing Iron Cross Street, almost reaching home,Klein suddenly thought of a question. He hesitated for a few seconds before asking," 

"Mr Smith,what is the treatment and salaries of the civilian staffs?"

This is a serious question...

Taken aback momentarily, Dunn smiled instantly after a few moments and answered," 

" There's no need for you to worry about this issue. Our funding is ensured and taken care of by the organization and police together. For newly registered civilian staffs, the weekly salaries are placed at two pounds and ten solis. This is coupled by ten solis of discretion and insurance allowance, which will add up to a total of three pounds, not much less than the official university lecturers." 

" Then after, your salary will gradually rise according to your experience and credit gained." 

" As for civilian staffs, the contract is often five years. After five years, you can quit normally if you're no longer willing to do the job. However, you have to sign another document that ensures your strict adherence to confidentiality and you're not allowed to leave Tingen until permission is given. If you want to move to another city, the first thing you have to do is to find the local Night Watchman to register." 

"By the way, there are no days off, only changing of shifts. At any point in time, there should be three civilian staffs on duty. If you wish to go to the South, to Desi Bay for a vacation, you'll need to arrange and settle the shifts with your colleagues."  

Just as Dunn finished speaking, the horse carriage pulled to a stop. The apartment that Klein and his family resided in appeared on the side.

"I get it now," Klein turned his body and walked down the horse carriage. He stopped at the side and asked," By the way Mr Smith, where do I find you after I've come to my decision?"

Dunn gave a low throaty laugh and said,"

"Go to the 'Hound Pub' at Besik Street and find their boss-Wright- and tell him that you want to hire The Mercenary Squad for a mission." 

"Huh?" Klein asked confusedly.

"Our location is kept as a secret too. Before you agree to become one of us,I can't tell you directly. Alright Mr Klein Moretti, I hope your night will also be filled with sweet dreams today," Dunn smiled as he said. 

Klein took off his cap and saluted, watching as the pace of the leaving horse carriage gradually sped up.

He took out his pocket watch, clicked open it and saw that it was only a little past four in the morning. The street was filled with a relaxing breeze, with dim yellowish light illuminating from the street lights from all four directions. 

Klein took a deep breath and felt the silence of the night eluding from the surroundings.

The busiest and nosiest street in the day could be so lifeless and silent at night . This was a stark contrast to Welch's apartment where there was just silent staring and psychic psychedel. 

It was only then did Klein realize that the back of his linen shirt was filled with sweat, cold and wet.
